                <dt id="q1">Who are the members of Heaven 17?</dt>
                <dd> The core of Heaven 17 was originally comprised of Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, a pair of
                    onetime computer operators who first teamed in 1977 as the Dead Daughters, a duo that integrated
                    synthesizer patterns with a heavy reliance on tape loops. Soon, Ware and Marsh were joined by
                    Philip
                    Oakey and Adi Newton and changed their name to the Human League, where they remained before
                    exiting
                    together in 1980.</dd>
                <dt id="q2">When did they rise to fame, and are they still famous now?</dt>
                <dd>In 1983 the band's fortunes changed. Their next single, "Temptation" (on which they were
                    augmented
                    by vocalist Carol Kenyon and a studio orchestra), reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in
                    spring
                    1983 and became their biggest hit. Today, you can still book them for events and such on their
                    official band website.</dd>
                <dt id="q3">Where did Heaven 17 originate?</dt>
                <dd>Heaven 17 is a British synthpop band originating in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England that was
                    formed in 1980, having much 80s success with their electronic sound.The name Heaven 17 is taken
                    directly from the novel A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess where a fictitious group named
                    "The
                    Heaven Seventeen" is mentioned by Alex when he visits a record shop.</dd>
                <dt id="q4">What genre of music do they make?</dt>
                <dd>They made unique music for their time including genres like Synthpop, New Wave, Dance-Pop, Pop
                    Rock,
                    Pop, Sophisti-Pop.develop their ideas based on electronics, soul music and disco influences with
                    occasional sorties back to a more recognisably Early Human League style via the British Electric
                    Foundation releases. The band as it stands now probably represents the most successful
                    commercial
                    combination of electronics with conventional instrumentation, a direction which the three band
                    members are keen to follow.</dd>
                <dt id="q5">Where can I find booking information for the band?</dt>
                <dd>Learn how to hire Heaven 17 or research availability and pricing for booking Heaven 17 to
                    perform at
                    a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow
                    or

                    their agency.</dd>
                <dt id="q6">How did they form?</dt>
                <dd>"The whole thing was accidental", explains Ware. "The Human League was basically an experiment
                    in
                    electronic pop: the only rule was there were to be no acoustic instruments, everything was to be
                    done with synthesisers. Unfortunately the synthesisers around at the time weren't capable of
                    doing
                    what we wanted them to do, even though we thought they were. "At that time we had no idea we
                    were
                    even capable of landing a record deal. Every group nowadays assumes they have a right to sign a
                    contract; in those days it had never occurred to us. The facilities weren't even there to do
                    demos
                    unless you really put your mind to it. Now anyone can knock out a demo of reasonable quality on
                    a
                    Portastudio."</dd>
                <dt id="q7">Who is B.E.F.?</dt>
                <dd>B.E.F. (British Electric Foundation) was a band/production company formed by former Human League
                    members Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh which became largely eclipsed by its best-known project,
                    Heaven 17 (with lead singer Glenn Gregory).</dd>
                <dt id="q8">What is Heaven 17 up to today?</dt>
                <dd>Heaven 17 continues with founding members Ware and singer Glenn Gregory; Marsh departed in 2006.
                    Though both have high-level multimedia gigs, they’re also working on an album together. “We’re
                    about
                    three-quarters of the way through, but finding time to get together is difficult, and it takes
                    some
                    record-label money to do it at the level we’d be proud of. So if you have a suitcase full of
                    money,
                    we’re interested.”</dd>
