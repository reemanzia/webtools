                <p>This is a picture of Heaven 17 when they were very famous. As you can see, they are all young and
                    two-thirds of them
                    are adorning somewhat
                    floppy headgear. This picture is from a photoshoot they did for a magazine, probably at some point
                    when
                    those
                    hats were trending.

                </figure>
                <p>How Men are is the hit album by Heaven 17, featuring two apparently two dead fish, a single rose, and
                    some
                    important conversation. Debuting in 1984, I'm sure this album revolutionized the way people percieve
                    how
                    men
                    are.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Heaven 17 is known for their unique fashion sense and creativity in style. Here you can see a band member
                    in a
                    snazzy, sequined hot pink suit in front of a large crowd. He is also wearing a cool, white cowboy hat.
                    Confidence is a fitting
                    term.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>With a cool, mysterious stoic look in their eyes, Heaven 17 puckers up for a photo shoot recently for
                    band
                    promotion. Notably missing a third person, as they split ways sometime decades ago. Maybe the somber
                    thematic is
                    in remembrance of the lost member.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>With 40 years under their belt, the band announces their mini European celebratory tour. in 2020, they
                    celebrated
                    by performing two nights in Sheffield and London. Curiously, they seem to have rebranded the spelling of
                    their
                    band name from "Heaven 17" to "Heaven Seventeen" here... but nowhere else on the internet does this
                    naming style
                    show up.</p>

                <h3>The Greatest Hit</h3>
                <figure>
                    <a href="_images/temptation-lg.jpg"><img src="_images/temptation-thumb.jpg" alt="Temptation (1983)"></a>
                    <figcaption>Temptation, their hit single.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Temptation, featuring Carol Kenyon, topped UK Singles charts in 1983 as number two. The song is still one
                    of
                    their biggest hits today, as they sing it at every event or concert. The music video is pretty cool too,
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_l5ETBRqFU">here</a> is
                    a link if you want to watch it yourself!
