        <figcaption>The band in their prime.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This is a picture of Heaven 17 when they were very famous. As you can see, they are all young and two-thirds of them
        are adorning somewhat
        floppy headgear. This picture is from a photoshoot they did for a magazine, probably at some point when those
        hats were trending.</p>

        <a href="_images/how-men-are-lg.jpg"><img src="_images/how-men-are-thumb.jpg" alt="How Men Are album cover." height="200"

        <figcaption>How Men Are (1984).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>How Men are is the hit album by Heaven 17, featuring two apparently two dead fish, a single rose, and some
        important conversation. Debuting in 1984, I'm sure this album revolutionized the way people percieve how men
        are.</p>

        <a href="_images/performance-lg.jpg"><img src="_images/performance-thumb.jpg" alt="Performing in a snazzy fit" height="200"

        <figcaption>A snazzy-fitted performance.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Heaven 17 is known for their unique fashion sense and creativity in style. Here you can see a band member in a
        snazzy, sequined hot pink suit in front of a large crowd. He is also wearing a cool, white cowboy hat.
        Confidence is a fitting
        term.</p>

        <a href="_images/recent-lg.jpeg"><img src="_images/recent-thumb.jpg" alt="A recent photo of the now duo." height="200"

        <figcaption>A recent photo of the band.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>With a cool, mysterious stoic look in their eyes, Heaven 17 puckers up for a photo shoot recently for band
        promotion. Notably missing a third person, as they split ways sometime decades ago. Maybe the somber thematic is
        in remembrance of the lost member.</p>

        <figcaption>40th anniversary announcement.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>With 40 years under their belt, the band announces their mini European celebratory tour. in 2020, they celebrated
        by performing two nights in Sheffield and London. Curiously, they seem to have rebranded the spelling of their
        band name from "Heaven 17" to "Heaven Seventeen" here... but nowhere else on the internet does this naming style
        show up.</p>

        <figcaption>Temptation, their hit single.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Temptation, featuring Carol Kenyon, topped UK Singles charts in 1983 as number two. The song is still one of
        their biggest hits today, as they sing it at every event or concert. The music video is pretty cool too, <a
