                    Taking their name from the Anthony Burgess novel <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, the U.K.
                    techno-pop trio
                    Heaven 17 grew out of the experimental dance project the British Electric Foundation, itself an
                    offshoot
                    of the electro-pop outfit Human League. The core of Heaven 17 was originally comprised of Martyn
                    Ware
                    and Ian Craig Marsh, a pair of onetime computer operators who first teamed in 1977 as the Dead
                    Daughters, a duo that integrated synthesizer patterns with a heavy reliance on tape loops. Soon,
                    Ware
                    and Marsh were joined by Philip Oakey and Adi Newton and changed their name to the Human League,
                    where
                    they remained before exiting together in 1980.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a means of establishing the synthesizer as an expressive, human instrument, Marsh and Ware
                    formed
                    the
                    British Electric Foundation, a production project that employed a variety of musicians and
                    singers
                    including Tina Turner, Sandie Shaw, and Gary Glitter. The B.E.F.'s debut, 1980's Music of
                    Quality
                    and
                    Distinction, Vol. 1, also included vocalist Glenn Gregory, a former photographer whom Ware and
                    Marsh
                    met
                    at a Sheffield drama center; in 1981, the duo enlisted Gregory for Heaven 17, the first and most
                    successful B.E.F. alter ego, and debuted with the single "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove
                    Thang," a
                    minor hit banned by the BBC over its title. An album, Penthouse and Pavement, followed the same
                    year.

                <p>
                    Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware were the founding members of pioneering Sheffield synthpop group
                    the
                    Human League; Glenn Gregory (who had previously been in a punk band called Musical Vomit with
                    Marsh)
                    had
                    been their original choice when seeking a lead singer for the band but as he had moved to London
                    to
                    work
                    as a photographer at the time, they chose Ware's school friend Philip Oakey instead. When
                    personal
                    and
                    creative tensions within the group reached a breaking point in late 1980, Marsh and Ware left
                    the
                    band,
                    ceding the Human League name to Oakey. They formed the production company British Electric
                    Foundation
                    (B.E.F.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    B.E.F.'s first recordings were a cassette-only album called Music for Stowaways and an LP called
                    Music
                    for Listening To, which was re-released on CD in 1997 with two extra tracks. Shortly after, they
                    completed their line-up when they recruited their friend, photographer Glenn Gregory, as
                    vocalist.
                    Taking their new name from a fictional pop band mentioned in Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel A
                    Clockwork Orange (where The Heaven Seventeen are at number 4 in the charts with "Inside"),
                    Heaven 17
                    was
                    intended to be just one of the musical projects for British Electric Foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the Human League, Heaven 17 used synthesisers and drum machines heavily (the Linn LM-1
                    programmed
                    by Ware). Session musicians were used for bass guitar and guitar (John Wilson) and grand piano
                    (Nick
                    Plytas). Whereas the band's former colleagues the Human League had gone on to major chart
                    success in
                    1981, Heaven 17 struggled to make an impact. Their debut single "(We Don't Need This) Fascist
                    Groove
                    Thang" attracted some attention and was banned by the BBC due to concerns by Radio 1's legal
                    department
                    that it libelled Ronald Reagan, who had recently been elected President of the United States.
                    Neither
                    "Fascist Groove Thang" nor any of the three other singles taken from the band's debut album
                    Penthouse
                    and Pavement reached the UK Top 40. The album itself proved to be a success, however, peaking at
                    Number
                    14 on the UK Albums Chart, and was later certified gold by the BPI in 1982.

                    In October 1982, Heaven 17 released their new single "Let Me Go", which charted just outside the
                    <strong>UK Top 40</strong> (but reached the Irish Top 30). However, in 1983 the band's fortunes
                    changed.
                    Their next single, "Temptation" (on which they were augmented by vocalist Carol Kenyon and a
                    studio
                    orchestra), reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in spring 1983 and became their biggest
                    hit.
                    The
                    song was taken from their second album, The Luxury Gap, which featured further chart hits "Come
                    Live
                    with Me" (UK #5) and "Crushed by the Wheels of Industry" (UK #17). The album itself charted at
                    number 4
                    on the UK Albums Chart, their highest ever position, and was certified platinum by the BPI in
                    1984.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The early 1990s was a quiet period for the band, though Ware produced a second B.E.F. album in
                    1991,
                    to
                    follow 1982's original Music of Quality & Distinction. This album again featured Tina Turner and
                    Billy
                    Mackenzie, but this time also featured artists such as Scritti Politti's Green Gartside, Lalah
                    Hathaway,
                    Billy Preston, and Chaka Khan. Ware also became a producer for the likes of Terence Trent
                    D'Arby,
                    Soft
                    Cell's Marc Almond, and Erasure. Gregory, meanwhile, went on to form the band Honeyroot with
                    Keith
                    Lowndes, then Ugly with John Uriel and Ian Wright . In late 1992, a Brothers in Rhythm remix of
                    "Temptation" reached number 4 and was followed by the compilation album Higher and Higher – The
                    Best
                    of
