                    <h3>The basics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Taking their name from the Anthony Burgess novel <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, the U.K.
                        techno-pop trio
                        Heaven 17 grew out of the experimental dance project the British Electric Foundation, itself an
                        offshoot
                        of the electro-pop outfit Human League. The core of Heaven 17 was originally comprised of Martyn
                        Ware
                        and Ian Craig Marsh, a pair of onetime computer operators who first teamed in 1977 as the Dead
                        Daughters, a duo that integrated synthesizer patterns with a heavy reliance on tape loops. Soon,
                        Ware
                        and Marsh were joined by Philip Oakey and Adi Newton and changed their name to the Human League,
                        where
                        they remained before exiting together in 1980.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a means of establishing the synthesizer as an expressive, human instrument, Marsh and Ware
                        formed
                        the
                        British Electric Foundation, a production project that employed a variety of musicians and
                        singers
                        including Tina Turner, Sandie Shaw, and Gary Glitter. The B.E.F.'s debut, 1980's Music of
                        Quality
                        and
                        Distinction, Vol. 1, also included vocalist Glenn Gregory, a former photographer whom Ware and
                        Marsh
                        met
                        at a Sheffield drama center; in 1981, the duo enlisted Gregory for Heaven 17, the first and most
                        successful B.E.F. alter ego, and debuted with the single "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove
                        Thang," a
                        minor hit banned by the BBC over its title. An album, Penthouse and Pavement, followed the same
                        year.

                    <h3>Origins and Early Career</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware were the founding members of pioneering Sheffield synthpop group
                        the
                        Human League; Glenn Gregory (who had previously been in a punk band called Musical Vomit with
                        Marsh)
                        had
                        been their original choice when seeking a lead singer for the band but as he had moved to London
                        to
                        work
                        as a photographer at the time, they chose Ware's school friend Philip Oakey instead. When
                        personal
                        and
                        creative tensions within the group reached a breaking point in late 1980, Marsh and Ware left
                        the
                        band,
                        ceding the Human League name to Oakey. They formed the production company British Electric
                        Foundation
                        (B.E.F.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        B.E.F.'s first recordings were a cassette-only album called Music for Stowaways and an LP called
                        Music
                        for Listening To, which was re-released on CD in 1997 with two extra tracks. Shortly after, they
                        completed their line-up when they recruited their friend, photographer Glenn Gregory, as
                        vocalist.
                        Taking their new name from a fictional pop band mentioned in Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel A
                        Clockwork Orange (where The Heaven Seventeen are at number 4 in the charts with "Inside"),
                        Heaven 17
                        was
                        intended to be just one of the musical projects for British Electric Foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like the Human League, Heaven 17 used synthesisers and drum machines heavily (the Linn LM-1
                        programmed
                        by Ware). Session musicians were used for bass guitar and guitar (John Wilson) and grand piano
                        (Nick
                        Plytas). Whereas the band's former colleagues the Human League had gone on to major chart
                        success in
                        1981, Heaven 17 struggled to make an impact. Their debut single "(We Don't Need This) Fascist
                        Groove
                        Thang" attracted some attention and was banned by the BBC due to concerns by Radio 1's legal
                        department
                        that it libelled Ronald Reagan, who had recently been elected President of the United States.
                        Neither
                        "Fascist Groove Thang" nor any of the three other singles taken from the band's debut album
                        Penthouse
                        and Pavement reached the UK Top 40. The album itself proved to be a success, however, peaking at
                        Number
                        14 on the UK Albums Chart, and was later certified gold by the BPI in 1982.

                    <h3>Their Music</h3>
                    <p>
                        In October 1982, Heaven 17 released their new single "Let Me Go", which charted just outside the
                        <strong>UK Top 40</strong> (but reached the Irish Top 30). However, in 1983 the band's fortunes
                        changed.
                        Their next single, "Temptation" (on which they were augmented by vocalist Carol Kenyon and a
                        studio
                        orchestra), reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in spring 1983 and became their biggest
                        hit.
                        The
                        song was taken from their second album, The Luxury Gap, which featured further chart hits "Come
                        Live
                        with Me" (UK #5) and "Crushed by the Wheels of Industry" (UK #17). The album itself charted at
                        number 4
                        on the UK Albums Chart, their highest ever position, and was certified platinum by the BPI in
                        1984.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The early 1990s was a quiet period for the band, though Ware produced a second B.E.F. album in
                        1991,
                        to
                        follow 1982's original Music of Quality & Distinction. This album again featured Tina Turner and
                        Billy
                        Mackenzie, but this time also featured artists such as Scritti Politti's Green Gartside, Lalah
                        Hathaway,
                        Billy Preston, and Chaka Khan. Ware also became a producer for the likes of Terence Trent
                        D'Arby,
                        Soft
                        Cell's Marc Almond, and Erasure. Gregory, meanwhile, went on to form the band Honeyroot with
                        Keith
                        Lowndes, then Ugly with John Uriel and Ian Wright . In late 1992, a Brothers in Rhythm remix of
                        "Temptation" reached number 4 and was followed by the compilation album Higher and Higher – The
                        Best
                        of
                        Heaven 17 in 1993. Remixes of "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" and "Penthouse and
                        Pavement"
                        were also minor hits in 1993. However, the band would not release any new material as Heaven 17
                        until
                        1996's Bigger Than America. The album failed to chart in the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 16 February 2010, Heaven 17 joined La Roux to record a joint live session for the BBC which
                        was
                        shown
                        on the BBC Red Button interactive channel in January 2010. Glenn Gregory joined La Roux on stage
                        at
                        Glastonbury Festival on 26 June 2010, performing "Temptation". (La Roux cite Heaven 17 as one of
                        their
                        main influences).[20] The two acts also appeared live on stage at the War Child Brit Awards
                        aftershow in
                        February 2010.The band appeared on Later... with Jools Holland on 22 October 2010, performing
                        "(We
                        Don't
                        Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" and "Temptation" and appeared in BBC Children in Need in
                        November
                        2010.
                        They also made a tongue-in-cheek appearance in TV advertisements for Sheffield-based broadband
                        provider
                        Plusnet. On 22 November, the band released a 2 disc DVD combining never-seen-before documentary
                        and
                        rehearsal footage with the band's full live concert filmed in Sheffield in March 2010. Also
                        included
                        was
                        a unique collection of all the digital videos used in the live show, set to the accompanying
                        live
                        audio
                        from the performance. Each video was commissioned from a different visual artist and included
                        both
                        established up-and-coming artists from the worlds of digital and graphic design, fine art, and
                        film.
                    </p>
                    <p>In September 2021 the group performed the first two Human League albums Reproduction (1979) and
                        Travelogue (1980) in Sheffield and London with long-standing collaborator Malcolm Garrett
                        providing
                        live
                        visuals on stage.
